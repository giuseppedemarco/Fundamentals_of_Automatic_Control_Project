# Fundamentals_of_Automatic_Control_Project
Fundamentals of Automatic Control - Exam Project

This repository contains the project developed for the Fundamentals of Automatic Control exam at the University of Calabria. The project explores three key topics: Markov Chains, Discrete-Time Systems, and Continuous-Time Systems. Each section provides detailed analyses, implementations, and simulations, offering a comprehensive understanding of these fundamental concepts in control systems. All computations and simulations were carried out using Mathematica.

The main components of the project include:

- Markov Chains: Analysis of state transitions, steady-state behavior, and graphical representation of transition graphs. Includes scripts for calculating steady-state vectors and simulating stochastic processes.
- Discrete-Time Systems: Implementation and analysis of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) discrete systems. Includes eigenvalue calculations, system response simulations (step, impulse, and natural modes), and transfer function derivations.
- Continuous-Time Systems: Study of LTI continuous systems with a focus on system dynamics, natural modes, transfer functions, and the computation of system responses. Includes VHDL implementations, matrix exponential calculations, and eigenvalue analysis.

This repository aims to provide a practical and theoretical approach to automatic control systems, making it suitable for educational purposes, demonstrations, and further research in the field. All code and analysis were performed using Mathematica to ensure precise and efficient computations.
